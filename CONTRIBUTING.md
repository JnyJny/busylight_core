# Contributing

We welcome contributions to busylight-core! This guide will help you get
started with development, testing, and submitting changes.

We have issues labeled as [Good First Issue][good-first-issue] and
[Help Wanted][help-wanted] which are good opportunities for new
contributors.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ 
- [uv][astra-uv] for dependency management
- Git for version control
- Optional: [direnv][direnv] for automatic environment activation

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JnyJny/busylight-core.git
   cd busylight-core
   ```

2. **Install dependencies and create virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   uv sync --all-groups
   ```

3. **Optional: Enable direnv for automatic environment activation:**
   ```bash
   direnv allow
   ```

4. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   uv run poe test
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Available Commands

The project uses [Poe the Poet][poe-the-poet]  for task
automation. Run `poe` without arguments to see all available tasks:

**Code Quality:**
- `poe test` - Run test suite with pytest
- `poe ruff-check` - Run ruff linting checks
- `poe ruff-format` - Format code with ruff
- `poe ruff` - Run both check and format
- `poe coverage` - Generate and open HTML coverage report

**Development:**
- `poe docs-serve` - Serve documentation locally for development
- `poe docs-build` - Build documentation
- `poe clean` - Remove build artifacts and cache files

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b features/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the project conventions

3. **Run quality checks:**
   ```bash
   poe ruff        # Format and lint code
   poe test        # Run tests
   poe coverage    # Check test coverage
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** using conventional commit format (see below)

5. **Push and create a pull request**

## Testing

### Running Tests

The project uses pytest with coverage reporting:

```bash
# Run all tests
poe test

# Run tests with coverage report
poe coverage

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_specific.py

# Run tests with verbose output
uv run pytest -v
```

### Test Structure

- `tests/` - Main test directory
- `tests/vendor_examples/` - Vendor-specific test examples
- Tests follow the naming convention `test_*.py`
- Mock hardware devices are used for testing (no real hardware required)

### Writing Tests

When adding new features:

1. **Create tests first** (TDD approach encouraged)
2. **Aim for >90% test coverage** for production code
3. **Test both success and error cases**
4. **Use descriptive test names** that explain the behavior being tested
5. **Mock hardware dependencies** - tests should not require real devices

Example test structure:
```python
def test_device_on_method_sets_color(self, mock_device) -> None:
    """Test that on() method properly sets device color."""
    mock_device.on((255, 0, 0))
    
    assert mock_device.color == (255, 0, 0)
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

**busylight-core** provides a unified interface for controlling USB-connected
status lights through a plugin-style architecture:

1. **Light** (src/busylight_core/light.py) - Abstract base class for all devices
2. **Hardware** (src/busylight_core/hardware.py) - Hardware detection and connection
3. **Vendor implementations** (src/busylight_core/vendors/) - Device-specific classes
4. **Mixins** (src/busylight_core/mixins/) - Shared functionality (ColorableMixin, TaskableMixin)

### Adding Device Support

To add support for a new device:

1. **Create or use existing vendor package** in `src/busylight_core/vendors/`
2. **Implement Light subclass** with required abstract methods:
   - `__bytes__()` - Device protocol serialization
   - `on()` - Turn on with color
   - `color` property - Get/set current color
3. **Define supported_device_ids** with vendor/product ID mappings
4. **Import in vendor's __init__.py** and add to `__all__`
5. **Import in main __init__.py** and add to main `__all__`
6. **Add comprehensive tests** following existing patterns

### Key Design Principles

- **Device-specific classes** enable type safety and plugin discovery
- **Minimal code duplication** (~5-10% is acceptable for hardware abstraction)
- **Clear inheritance hierarchies** with vendor base classes
- **Comprehensive test coverage** with mocked hardware

## Commit Message Format

This project uses conventional commits for automatic changelog generation.
Use these prefixes in your commit messages:

- **feat:** New features and capabilities
- **fix:** Bug fixes and corrections  
- **docs:** Documentation updates
- **refactor:** Code restructuring without behavior changes
- **perf:** Performance improvements
- **test:** Test additions or modifications

**Examples:**
```bash
feat: add support for NewVendor SuperLight device
fix: resolve color parsing issue in Blynclight
docs: update contributing guidelines for new developers
refactor: simplify vendor base class hierarchy
perf: optimize Word.__str__ BitField introspection
test: add comprehensive tests for multi-LED devices
```

**Commit format:**
```

[optional footer]
```

## Code Style

### Formatting and Linting

The project uses [ruff][astral-ruff] for code formatting and linting:

- **Line length:** 80 characters for markdown, flexible for code
- **Docstrings:** Sphinx reStructuredText format with single-line summary
- **Type hints:** Required for all public APIs
- **Import sorting:** Automatic via ruff

### Code Conventions

- **Descriptive variable names** that explain purpose, not implementation
- **No comments** - prefer clear code and comprehensive docstrings
- **Exception handling:** Use descriptive variable names (`error` not `e`)
- **Clean exceptions:** Use `contextlib.suppress` instead of `try/except/pass`

### Docstring Format

Use **Sphinx reStructuredText format** focusing on programmer intent rather 
than type information (which is covered by type hints):

```python
def on(self, color: tuple[int, int, int], led: int = 0) -> None:
    """Turn on the light with specified RGB color.

    Sets the device to display the given color immediately. For devices
    with multiple LEDs, use led parameter to target specific LEDs or 
    0 for all LEDs.

    :param color: RGB values from 0-255 for desired color intensity
    :param led: Target LED index, 0 affects all LEDs
    :raises LightUnavailableError: If device communication fails
    """

def get_colors(self) -> list[tuple[int, int, int]]:
    """Get current colors of all LEDs.

    Returns the current color state for each LED in device order.
    Use this to save current state before making temporary changes.

    :return: List of RGB tuples, one per LED in device order
    """
```

**Key principles:**
- **Single-line summary** describing the action or purpose
- **Document programmer intent** - how and why other code should use this
- **Expected inputs** - value ranges, expected content, usage patterns
- **Actions taken** - what happens when called, side effects
- **Exception conditions** - when might this fail and why
- **Return value usage** - how should returned values be used
- **Avoid type redundancy** - type hints handle type information
- **Compact format** - use `:param name: description` rather than verbose sections

## Documentation

### Building Documentation

The project uses MkDocs with the Material theme:

```bash
# Serve locally for development
poe docs-serve

# Build for production
poe docs-build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages (maintainers only)
poe docs-deploy
```

### Writing Documentation

- **API documentation** is auto-generated from docstrings
- **Guides and examples** go in the `docs/` directory
- **Follow 80-column line width** for markdown files
- **Use descriptive headers** and clear examples

## Releases

### Python Version Configuration

The CI/CD test matrix uses Python versions configured in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.busylight_core.ci]
test-python-versions = ["3.11", "3.12", "3.13"]
```

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for CI test versions
- Automatic workflow updates when versions change
- Graceful fallback if configuration missing

**Note:** Changing these versions affects all CI/CD testing across the project.

### For Maintainers

Releases are handled through Poe tasks and GitHub Actions:

1. **Create release:**
   ```bash
   poe publish_patch   # 0.1.0 → 0.1.1
   poe publish_minor   # 0.1.1 → 0.2.0
   poe publish_major   # 0.2.0 → 1.0.0
   ```

2. **Automated CI/CD pipeline:**
   - Version bump in pyproject.toml
   - Git commit, tag, and push
   - GitHub Actions: `get-python-versions` → `test` → `build` → [`publish`, `github-release`] → `docs`
   - Parallel execution: PyPI publishing and GitHub release creation run simultaneously
   - Documentation deployment: Only triggered after successful releases
   <!-- add a mermaid diagram here for the ci/cd pipline -->

### Changelog

- **Features** from `feat:` commits
- **Bug Fixes** from `fix:` and `bug:` commits  
- **Documentation** from `docs:` commits
- **Refactoring** from `refactor:` commits
- **Performance** from `perf:` commits
